# Rules
Shake ya phone, roll the dice. The dice determines your disability. The lower your handicap, the more points you can get.

Player one defines to player two from his/her team the words. Player two has to guess the words.

What you may do:
+ The word describe \ singing \ humming or depict
+ Using determiners in words
What you may not do:
- Say the words on the card
- Words who are derived of the words on card
- "Sounds like" or "rhymes" tactics
- Refer to a letter or letters in the alphabet
- Indicate to something

When the 42 seconds are up, the other team has to check the answers.

The score of the team is the number of correctly guessed words minus handicap. If the score is less than 0, the score is 0.

The team who achieved to most points after playing all rounds wins!
